The next guide describes the steps to get Archlinux installed under UEFI (GPT) partition system.

1. Boot properly through your Live USB or any prefered way
2. when you reach the shell window with a root prompt to write, everything starts.

3. Follow the next codes to get the installation:

  a) Check if you can access Internet with the following command, assuming LAN cable is conected.
        
        ping -c6 www.linuxbabe.com

     You can use the following command to connect to Wi-Fi networks.
        wifi-menu
        
  b) Set US keyboard as the keyboard layout:
        
        loadkeys us
        
  c) Now let’s configure the disk. Assuming that the disk is only to this proccess, ou can run the following command to find out the name of your hard drive.
        
        parted -l
        
        * Usually /dev/sda is the name of the hard drive and /dev/sr0 refers to the ArchLinux ISO.

     To create the partition table GPT (GUID Partition Table) instead of in MBR (Master Boot Record).

        parted /dev/sda mklabel gpt
        
        *You can confirm it’s a GPT disk using this command:

        parted /dev/sda -l
        
     Make parted use /dev/sda.

        parted /dev/sda
        
     Use the next command to start a disk partition utility gui, and create at least the EFI and Root partitions. Optional: SWAP partition.
     EFI partition is recomended to be around 500M (I recommend 512 MB)
     
        cfdisk
        
        *create EFI partition: Size - 512M (recommended), Type - EFI File System
        *create Root partition: Size - (rest of free space minus swap), Type - Linux File System
        *create Swap partition: Size - (2G or 4G recommended), Type - EFI File System
        *write out the partitions to the disk
        *finally quit the cfdisk utility

     Use the next comands to format the disk partitions.
     
        fdisk -l
        
        *this command returns the disk with partitions. Check that EFI partition says "esp boot", otherwise
        
        set 1 boot on
        
        */dev/sda1 should be EFI    |
        */dev/sda2 should be Root   |  In this guide
        */dev/sda3 should be Swap   |

        mkfs -t fat /dev/sda1
        mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda2
        mkswap /dev/sda3
        swapon /dev/sda3
        
  d) Now let's mount the disk partitions to start the installation.
  
     To mount the root partition under /mnt.
        
        mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
        
     Make a boot directory on root partition.
     
        mkdir /mnt/boot
         
     Mount the EFI system partition under /mnt/boot/

        mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/
        
  e) Now let's start the installation of files
        
        nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
        
        *to select a mirror that is close to your location, copy that mirror address to the top of the mirror list
        *ctrl k > cut
        *ctrl u > paste
        *ctrl o > save
        *ctrl x > exit
     
     First update the linux keyring to avoid signature of files issues.
     
        pacman -S archlinux-keyring
     
     Now run the following command to install ArchLinux base system with the Linux kernel and Nano text editor on root partition.

        pacstrap -i /mnt base linux linux-firmware nano
        
        *press Enter to select the default repository source.
        *enter Y to accept the download and installation of files
