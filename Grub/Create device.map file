1. If there is an old device.map file run the next command to avoid eliminating it
    sudo mv /boot/grub/device.map /boot/grub/device.map.bak

2. Now, to generate the new device.map file just type the following command
    sudo grub â€“device-map=/boot/grub/device.map

3. Now grub-customizer and other grub apps will see the device.map file created
