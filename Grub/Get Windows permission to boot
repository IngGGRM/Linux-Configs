If after Linux installation Windows keeps going on, evading Grub do as follows

1. In Windows administrative cmd window type the following

        bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\debian\grubx64.efi
        
        See that the folder "debian" here is the name of the /boot/efi/EFI/"YOUR_DISTRO_NAME"
        for example, manjaro distro uses "manjaro", pop_os distro uses "pop", etc
