When the issue shows during boot, can be 2 modes to access the system to perform a fix

1. In grub minimal-bash window type
    ls      (this will show the disk partitions)
    
2. type the following commands in order (assuming hd0,gpt1 as your EFI partition and hd0,gpt2 as your linux partition)

    set root=(hd0,2)
    set prefix=(hd0,2)/boot/grub
    insmod normal
    normal
    
3. Now your system should boot, perform an efi-grub repair process

4. If you found problems with the step 1 or step 2 type the next commands (assuming hd0,gpt1 as your EFI partition and hd0,gpt2 as your linux partition)

    linux (hd1,6)/boot/vm[press TAB to auto-complete] root=/dev/sda2
    initrd (hd1,6)/boot/ini[press TAB to auto-complete]
    
    boot

|   GRUB REPAIR PROCESS AFTER STARTING YOUR LINUX SYSTEM   |
|----------------------------------------------------------|

Type in a shel the following commands (assuming /dev/sda is your drive)

    sudo update-grub
    grub-install /dev/sda
    sudo cp /boot/grub/x86_64-efi/grub.efi /boot/efi/EFI/pop/grubx64.efi
    
in the last line the directory "pop" is given for the OS, example "manjaro", "ubuntu", "mint", "arch", etc. In this case is for POP_OS!
