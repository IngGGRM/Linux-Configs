In first step, be sure to install Wine(staging in my case), WineTricks, PlayOnLinux(fastest way to create blottled wine-prefixes)
In PlayOnLinux, create a virtual device as you're going to install the game "Red Alert 3" (becouse Red Alert 2 is not listed)
Follow the installation steps and let PlayOnLinux install your RA2 Setup instead, finally it will give an error about RA3 executables, just ignore it
Configure PlayOnLinux RA3 virtual device, in "Wine/Configure Wine" tab set in Application tab WindowsXP and in Libraries tab just add the following libs (no matter if shows a warning):
    |---LIB----|---EDIT---|
    |          |          |
    |  ddraw   |  native  |
    | wsock32  |  native  |

Now in PlayOnLinux RA3 virtual device "Component Install" tab install
    DotNet20sp2, Gecko, vcRun2008, xna40, in that order
In PlayOnLinux RA3 virtual device "Misc" tab click on "Open Virtual Drive Directory"
    Place MentalOmega folder in drive_c and copy from drive_C/program files/RA2 the following:
        BINKW32.dll, BLOWFISH.dll, gamemd.exe, ra2.mix, ra2md.mix, language.mix, langmd.mix
        
        Also delete the following from Mental Omega directory:
            All .wav and .wma files in Rosources and Resources/MainMenu
            All .xnb files except "SpriteFont" ones.
   
Now return to PlayOnLinux RA3 virtual drive configuration, in "General" tab click on "Create Shortcut.."
    CLick in explore and go throgh the RA3 drive_c to Mental Omega folder and select "MentalOmegaClient.exe"
    If the app give you an error running, use xnaClient.exe in MentalOmega/Resources/ instead of MentalOmegaClient.exe

Now you can run the game through the shortcut created in desktop or in PlayOnLinux gui. Open and update the launcher.

After updates, try to secure that the game works, just start a match to see.
    Some workarounds to let it run:
        Set game graphics to Low and after that try different combinations.
        Set game renderer to TSDDraw.

|------------------------------------|
|   Lutris and MangoHud workaround   |
|------------------------------------|

To get this launcher play through Lutris, have to make an executable file somewhere in your home folder and set "EXEC" to your version of the next command:

    /usr/share/playonlinux/playonlinux --run "MentalOmegaClient" %F (to find yours just cat the .desktop file of the shortcut created by PlayOnLinux)
    give it execute permissions and try to run it, the game should run through it.

Now start adding a new game in Lutris with "Steam Runs Steam Games" in runner and in executable file look for the file created behind.
    If it gives and error runnig, edit executable file and add "bash " in front of exec line

To manage MangoHud first install it with https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud
then, with MentalOmega through Lutris edit executable file and add "MANGOHUD_DLSYM=1 " in front of exec line, and set Lutris "FPS Couner (MangoHud)" to OpenGL
